# passwd-shell-benchmarks

A motley collection of quick hacks to count the occurrences of each login shell in a passwd file

As written, they expect a unix style password file in the current directory, called "passwd"

So far there are benchmarks written in c, go, shell/awk, python, perl, bash. node, lisp, julia, ruby and ms powershell
